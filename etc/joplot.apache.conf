  ## example: use X.509/SSL-certificate authentication for authorizing
  ## users; requires that an entry is created in the `htpasswd` file
  ## above for each certificate to be authorized: each line should
  ## contain a DN, immediately followed by the string
  ## ``:xxj31ZMTZzkVA``. Example::
  ##
  ##    /DC=ch/DC=switch/DC=slcs/O=ETH Zuerich/CN=Riccardo Murri FF02AE12:xxj31ZMTZzkVA
  ##
  ## In theory, this can be freely mixed with the username/password
  ## basic auth.  In practice the magic string ``xxj31ZMTZzkVA`` above
  ## is just a hashed version of the string "password", so if you do
  ## mix username/password auth and certificate-based auth, anyone can
  ## log in by just entering the certificate DN as username and
  ## "password" as password.  So it's not a good idea, after all.
